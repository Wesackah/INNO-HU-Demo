# Serving tensorflow model with Flask

The aim of this project is to demo speech emotion recognition using the model trained with Convolutional Neural Network, described in https://github.com/MITESHPUTHRANNEU/Speech-Emotion-Analyzer 

# Requirement
- Python >=2.7 or >=3.4
- TensorFlow >=1.0 & <2.0
- Flask


# How to run
 $python app.py
 
 Then open [localhost:5000](localhost:5000)
 

Bugs: 
- Model is not optimized fo tensorflow 2.0 
- serving in flask is suboptimal
